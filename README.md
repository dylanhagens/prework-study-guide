# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description

The motivation to get through this prework study guide was to prove to myself that I can get down the basics of coding. Building this project taught me the intro skills to be able to tackle HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript basics. Going through this course we created certain issues to learn how to solve the problems certain keystrokes can cause. Attantion to detial is the big takeaway I have learned with coding.
